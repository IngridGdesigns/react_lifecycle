shouldComponentUpdate is a great place to improve the performance of a component 
because it can help to prevent unnecessary re-rendering. However, it is advised not 
to use this method for deep equality checks or JSON.stringify as this is very 
inefficient and may harm performance.

  //  shouldComponentUpdate is used to let React know that a componentâ€™s output is not 
  //  affected by a change of props or state in the component and thus should not re-render. 
  //  It returns either a true or false value. If it returns true, the component will go ahead 
  //  and do what it always does, re-render the component. If it returns false then the component 
  //  will not update. Note that this does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.

  //  The best way to use this method is to have it return false and hence the component will not 
  //  update under certain conditions. If those conditions are met, then the component does not update.
   shouldComponentUpdate(newProps, nextState) {
     console.log('Should component UPDATE? YES...button was pressed, update count')

//    componentWillUpdate is called just before rendering. This method is called right before the update call to render.
// There is nothing different about this render call compared to the call for the initial render.
// This point is very important to React.
// Your render function should not differentiate whether this is the initial render or an update.
// This is the heart of React takes render's return value and compares it to the return value last 
//time render was called and decides what updates to make, if any.
// The reconciliation process that we'll dive into next chapter.
// After reconciliation, React will recursively mount, update, and unmount child components as needed.
// Once the process resolves to base virtual DOM components, React updates the actual DOM
   componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState){
     console.log('Component WILL UPDATE, press button to see')

   /*
   componentDidUpdate is called after any rendered HTML has finished loading. It receives two arguments, 
   the props and state of the component before the current updating period began.
componentDidUpdate is the best place to perform interaction with non-React environment like the browser 
or making HTTP requests. This should be done as long as you compare the 
current props to the previous props to avoid unnecessary network requests.

//    componentWillUnmount is called after the component is unmounted from the dom.

// canceling network requests, removing event listeners or canceling any subscriptions made in 
// componentDidMount.
//We are unmounting our component in app.js.
// In our example we are setting initial state in constructor function.
